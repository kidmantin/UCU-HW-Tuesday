# Alignment Decoding
My task was to decode an audio, from LibriSpeech dec-clean, to text using [provided LSTM acoustic model](https://gist.github.com/proger/a7e820fbfa0181273fdbf2351901d0d8) and check decoding in [praat software](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/)
Code I used to do it is in vivtorok.ipynb
